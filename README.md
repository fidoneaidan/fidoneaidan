<h3>🔭 Mission Statement</h3>

I am an engineer driven by **first-principles** design and the challenge of deploying complex hardware in unforgiving environments. My work focuses on the intersection of **iterative mechanical design** and 
**simulation-driven optimization**. I specialize in closing the gap between **virtual validation (CFD/FEA)** and **physical performance**, ensuring that every component is engineered for maximum efficiency, 
safety, and field-serviceability.
