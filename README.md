# Hi, I’m Aidan Fidone 👋

### **Mechanical Design & Systems Engineer | Aerospace Engineering @ Texas A&M**
**NASA L'SPACE Alumnus • FEDC Red Badge • Simulation & Fabrication Specialist**

I am an Aerospace Engineering student at Texas A&M University
specializing in **Mechanical Systems and Design**. I bridge the gap
between high-fidelity aerospace simulations and physical hardware
fabrication, with a core focus on **structural optimization** and
**robotic actuation**.

### 🚀 Key Projects (Consistent with Resume)

#### **[Oceanus | MATE ROV Propulsion Lead]**
* **High-Torque Joint & Actuation:** Designed and optimized thruster
shroud assemblies and gear-meshing components using **SolidWorks**.
* **Structural FEA:** Performed **Ansys Mechanical** simulations to
identify stress concentrations, reducing component mass while
maintaining a 1.5 Safety Factor.
* **Precision Manufacturing:** Applied **ASME Y14.5 (GD&T)** standards
to ensure concentricity and fitment for high-speed rotating parts.

#### **[AeroArcadia | Flight Systems Lead]**
* **Design-Build-Test:** Led the hardware lifecycle for high-power
rocketry, correlating Python-based flight models with real-world
telemetry.
* **Aerodynamic Validation:** Utilized **First Principles** to
optimize drag coefficients ($C_d$) and airframe stability margins.

### 🔬 Engineering Philosophy
I believe that high-performance hardware is born from **closing the
loop** between simulation and the shop floor. My "Red Badge"
certification from the FEDC allows me to validate my digital twins
through physical testing—ensuring every part I design is optimized for
**Giga-scale** manufacturing and assembly.
